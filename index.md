## About
I am an Associate Professor at the <a href="http://csai.nl">Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence</a> at 
<a href="http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/">Tilburg University</a>, the Netherlands.

## Research Interests

I am mainly interested in studying language learning using computational models. My main area of research is modeling grounded language learning, the impact of interaction in language acquisition and processing, and developing tools and techniques for better understanding of emergent linguistic representations in (neural) models of language.

## News and Activities

- Received an e-Science Center/NWO grant for the project "Understanding visually grounded spoken language via multi-tasking" (apply [here]).
- Organizer of <a href="">BlackboxNLP</a> workshop at <a href="">EMNLP 2018</a>.
- Area chair for <a href="http://coling2018.org/">COLING 2018</a>.
