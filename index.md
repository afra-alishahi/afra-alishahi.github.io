I am an Associate Professor at the <a href="http://csai.nl">Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence</a> at 
<a href="http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/">Tilburg University</a>, the Netherlands.

## Research Interests

I am mainly interested in studying language learning using computational models. My main area of research is modeling grounded language learning, the impact of interaction in language acquisition and processing, and developing tools and techniques for better understanding of emergent linguistic representations in (neural) models of language.
